# Keras-FCN

This is a Keras implementation of the fully convolutional network outlined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06211" target="_blank">Shelhamer et al (2016)</a>, which performs semantic image segmentation according to the <a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/">Pascal VOC Challenge</a>.
This readme will present the results and then outline the basics of the implementation.
My hope is that this will be readable to non-technical persons, such as myself, who are looking to learn about fully convolutional networks.

For a quick introduction, see <a href=https://towardsdatascience.com/review-fcn-semantic-segmentation-eb8c9b50d2d1">this article</a>.
